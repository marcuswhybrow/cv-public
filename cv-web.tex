    \textbf{Aware Monitoring} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Python Developer}, website and application \hfill \textbf{June 2010 -- Octover 2010}\\
    Aware Monitoring provides page load time monitoring services to huge websites such as huddle.com and wiggle.com and is always on a drive to gain new customers.
	Joining Aware Monitoring over the summer period between my second and final year at University, I worked on multiple individual projects having sole responsibility for each.

	Being a new member of a small concentrated team developing and adding features to a critical application, I would create or modify code in isolation and hand over to them for integration into their more complex structure. Thus well written code and documentation was a must.
	Tasks included the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Django was the framework which powered their application and it was my responsibility to convert the companies existing public facing website from the PHP based ExpressionEngine into a Django site, whilst integrating designs from a separate website design company, the result can be seen at http://awaremonitoring.com/.
		\item Rewriting ageing python utility functions which were used in support of the application.
		\item Adding features to the existing application in keeping with the all important visual style.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Additional Responsibilities: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Working occasional weekends during/between university semesters after the period of employment to add new features based upon earlier work.
	\end{itemize}

    \section{\mysidestyle Open-Source\\Projects}

    \textbf{TinyGraph SNMP Monitoring}\vspace{1mm}\\%
    TinyGraph is born out of the frustration of using other network monitoring tools, and sets forth with the vision that monitoring your devices should be fun. This project is written in Python using the Django framework and makes heavy use of jQuery and SVG elements.
    \vspace{-1.5mm}
    
    \textbf{AutoLibrarian Digital Library}\vspace{1mm}\\%
    AutoLibrarian is a another Python/Django project which makes use of the Google books API to bring useful information to the books which users store within it. The project also has an Android app which can scan the barcode of a book's ISBN number for easy input.
    \vspace{-1.5mm}
    
    \textbf{jQuery State Bindings}\vspace{1mm}\\%
	A plugin for the JavaScript library jQuery, which allows the grouping of event bindings. These groups can then be enabled or disabled based upon the global "state" of your page, created for use with TinyGraph.
